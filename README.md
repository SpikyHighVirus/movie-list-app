## 📖 About This Project  

This project was created as a way to practice working with APIs and React. It fetches movie data from **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The app features a responsive design and allows users to search for their favorite movies or browse through trending titles.  

The main purpose of this project was to improve my skills in:  
- Working with external APIs.  
- Building a clean and responsive UI with React.  
- Managing state and handling asynchronous data fetching.  
- Deploying projects using modern tools like Netlify.
